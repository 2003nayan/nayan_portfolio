# Gemini Codebase Context

This file provides context for the Gemini large language model to understand the codebase.

## Codebase Overview

This is a Next.js portfolio website.

- `src/app`: Main application code.
- `src/components`: Reusable React components.
- `src/data`: Data files, such as blog posts and project information.
- `public`: Static assets, such as images and fonts.
- `content`: Markdown files for blog posts.

## Memories

- Whenever I make changes to the codebase, I must update the `Changes.md` file with detailed information about the changes.
