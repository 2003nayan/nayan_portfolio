  about:
    "„ÇÑ„ÅÇ, I‚Äôm Rahul, a Fullstack dev with a frontend edge based in Mumbai/Pune, Intern in [Next carbon](https://github.com/Nextc1/Next_carbon) Project under IITM. I‚Äôm all about crafting slick Pixel Perfect UIs, building Saas software, and pushing the boundaries and discovering of AI/ML, Web3. Always experimenting, always building‚Äîbecause the ecosystem never sleeps..\n\nWhen I'm not deep in the code, I'm learning guitar, or skecting / painting. And yeah, Virat Kohli?  Watching him bat is like witnessing controlled chaos‚Äîprecision, aggression, and absolute mastery. Every innings, a lesson in dominance. Catch you in the field!",

  bio: "Code is my chaos, shipping is my control. \n\nI‚Äôm Nayan, a full-stack cracked dev from Pune turning caffeine and ideas into SaaS, collab tools, and Web3 experiences. CreatorsBrain, Collaborix, NFT marketplaces, every project is a remix of performance, design, and a little madness.",
  career:
    "ÁßÅ ‡§∞‡§æ‡§π‡•Å‡§≤, Started my dev journey at 17, hacking away in 11th grade‚Äîbeen building, breaking, or learning ever since and it's been a rollercoaster ride since then.",
  careerFull:
    "I started breaking things on purpose at 17 ‚Äî 11th grade, one laptop, and a head full of questions. The pandemic handed me my first machine for online classes; my uncle showed me how the web actually works under the hood, and I never looked back. What began as casual tinkering with HTML & CSS turned into a habit of building, breaking, and rebuilding until things felt ‚Äî and moved ‚Äî right. \n\nSince then I‚Äôve shipped full products end-to-end: AI-powered SaaS that actually moved the needle for creators, realtime collaboration tools, and UX-forward Web3 marketplaces. I prefer the stack that lets me move fast without losing polish ‚Äî Next.js/React/TypeScript on the front, pragmatic Node backends, and a few cloud tricks to keep things reliable and scalable. My obsession is tiny interactions and tiny latencies: if the UI feels snappy, people keep coming back.\n\nI care about outcomes. One of my projects boosted creator CTR by meaningful margins across thousands of videos; another smoothed out wallet flows so marketplaces don‚Äôt stall at login. But metrics are just proof ‚Äî what I really chase is building systems that make other people‚Äôs work easier, faster, and more delightful.\n\nWhen I‚Äôm not arguing with a stubborn bug, you‚Äôll find me sketching ideas, learning guitar, or over-experimenting with some new AI toy. The ride‚Äôs been wild so far ‚Äî and honestly, it‚Äôs only getting started. üöÄ",
