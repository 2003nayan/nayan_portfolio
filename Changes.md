## Detailed Change Documentation

### Change #1: Work Configuration Data Structure Compatibility

**1. Reason of Change**
The work configuration file (`work.config.tsx`) was updated with a new data structure that uses different property names and organization. Components needed to be updated to handle both old and new data structures for backward compatibility while maintaining existing functionality.

**New Structure Properties:**

- `company` instead of `title` for organization names
- `roles.title` instead of `roles.role` for position names
- `roles.date` instead of `roles.dates` for time periods
- `roles.points` (string array) instead of `roles.description` (object array)

**2. Files Changed**

- `src/components/grid-cards.tsx`
- `src/app/about/page.tsx`

**3. Impact from the Change**

- **Backward Compatibility**: Components support both old and new data structures
- **Flexibility**: Handles mixed data formats within the same configuration array
- **Type Safety**: Added proper fallbacks and type assertions to prevent runtime errors
- **Visual Consistency**: Maintains consistent presentation across grid and timeline views
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Company logos and links only render when available

### Change #2: README.md Complete Rewrite

**1. Reason of Change**
The original README.md contained outdated information that didn't accurately reflect the current codebase features, architecture, and setup process. A comprehensive rewrite was needed to provide accurate documentation for the modern Next.js 14 App Router architecture.

**2. Files Changed**

- `README.md`

**3. Impact from the Change**

- **Developer Onboarding**: Clear setup instructions and project understanding
- **Feature Visibility**: All current features properly documented with emojis
- **Technical Accuracy**: Documentation matches actual implementation
- **Professional Presentation**: Modern formatting improves project credibility
- **SEO Benefits**: Better project description for GitHub discoverability

### Change #3: CLAUDE.md Creation

**1. Reason of Change**
Created dedicated guidance documentation for Claude Code to understand project architecture, commands, and development workflow, enabling more effective AI-assisted development.

**2. Files Changed**

- `CLAUDE.md` (new file)

**3. Impact from the Change**

- **AI Development Efficiency**: Future Claude sessions can quickly understand structure
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Key architectural decisions documented
- **Consistent Development**: Standardized guidance for AI assistance
- **Faster Context Loading**: Reduces time for AI to understand codebase

### Change #4: Syntax and Type Error Fixes

**1. Reason of Change**
Fixed critical syntax and TypeScript compilation errors that were preventing the application from running correctly.

**2. Files Changed**

- `src/app/about/page.tsx` (incomplete ternary operator)
- `src/components/grid-cards.tsx` (TypeScript link typing)

**3. Impact from the Change**

- **Application Stability**: Eliminated compilation errors and runtime crashes
- **Type Safety**: Proper type handling for dynamic data structures
- **Development Experience**: Clean builds without TypeScript warnings
